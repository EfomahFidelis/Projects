### [Predicting Movie Rental Durations](https://github.com/EfomahFidelis/Predicting-Movie-Rental-Durations/blob/main/Predict_movie_rental_durations.ipynb)<br>
<strong>Introduction:</strong><br>
In this project, I built regression models to predict the number of days a customer is likely to rent a DVD based on specific customer and movie features. The rental company sought to improve their inventory planning and operational efficiency using predictive analytics, with a key performance goal of achieving a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 3 or less on the test set.

During this analysis, I performed extensive data exploration, including visualizations and statistical analysis, to uncover critical insights. For example:  
- **Correlation Heatmap Analysis**: Revealed relationships between numerical features, aiding feature selection and reducing multicollinearity.  
- **PG Rating Distribution**: Analyzed binary distributions of PG ratings to confirm its limited influence on regression modeling.  
- **Lasso Regression Coefficients**: Showed how specific features such as rental amount and rental rate affect the predicted rental duration.  

The final model, a DecisionTreeRegressor, achieved an MSE of 2.5036, outperforming the company’s benchmark. This project highlights the power of regression modeling in enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions and optimize resource planning.

<strong>Technology:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor)</li>
  <li>Pandas</li>
  <li>Seaborn</li>
  <li>Matplotlib</li>
</ul>

<strong>Results:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Developed a regression model with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 2.5036, exceeding the company's performance benchmark of MSE ≤ 3</li>
  <li>Showcased expertise in optimizing models through effective parameter tuning, data transformation, and robust evaluation techniques</li>

### [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://github.com/EfomahFidelis/Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster/blob/main/venv_titanic_disaster/titanic_ml_project.ipynb)<br>
<strong>Introduction:</strong><br>
This project employs machine learning techniques to predict the survival likelihood of Titanic passengers based on demographic, social, and economic features. Using a dataset containing passenger information such as age, gender, ticket class, and more, the project explores relationships between features and survival rates, applies feature engineering, and builds a Random Forest Classifier to produce predictions. The aim is to identify key survival factors while refining data science and machine learning workflows.

<strong>Methodology:</strong>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis:</strong> Visualized survival distributions and key variables such as gender and age to understand patterns.</li>
  <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Derived new features like family size, isolation status, and cabin presence.</li>
      <li>Extracted titles from passenger names to capture social standing.</li>
      <li>Imputed missing data for age, fare, and embarked location.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> One-hot encoded categorical features and ensured feature alignment between training and test datasets.</li>
  <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> Utilized a Random Forest Classifier with hyperparameter tuning to predict survival outcomes.</li>
  <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Analyzed feature importance to identify significant predictors of survival.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Technology:</strong>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Python</li>
  <li><strong>Libraries:</strong> Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib</li>
</ul>

<strong>Results:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Trained a Random Forest Classifier that effectively predicts survival with key features such as gender, fare, and family-related variables.</li>
  <li>Visualizations highlighted the importance of variables like social class (<strong>Class</strong>) and gender in predicting survival.</li>
  <li>Demonstrated practical experience in feature engineering, data preprocessing, and implementing machine learning workflows.</li>
</ul>
