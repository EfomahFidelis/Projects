* ## AI / ML Project
### [Pre-trained Image Classifier for Dog Breed Identification](https://github.com/EfomahFidelis/Project-Use-a-Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds/edit/main/README.md)
<strong>AI Programming with Python (Udacity Course, AWS-sponsored Nanodegree)</strong> <br> Developed an efficient image classification application to identify dog breeds using pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Implemented and compared multiple CNN architectures (AlexNet, VGG, ResNet) to optimize accuracy.

<strong>Technology:</strong>
  * Python
  * Pre-trained CNNs (AlexNet, VGG, ResNet)

<b>Results:</b>
  * Successfully developed an efficient image classification application for dog breed identification
  * Optimized dog breed identification accuracy by comparing multiple CNN architectures
  * Demonstrated proficiency in working with deep learning models and transfer learning techniques
  * Gained hands-on experience with real-world AI application development and best practices in AI engineering
